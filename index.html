        <strong>Overclocking</strong> is the process of increasing the clock rate of a computer to exceed that certified by the manufacturer.
        It is typically done to increase the performance of a component, e.g. the processor or the graphics card.
        Actual real world performance increase varies from one component to another, but can be as high as 20%.
        Most components are designed with a margin of safety to deal with operating conditions outside of the rated specifications.
        Components that are run beyond their rated specifications may operate in a degraded electrical state; e.g. more heat, higher current consumption and lower stability.
        Overclocking is typically more feasible on desktop personal computers than on laptops, where the cramped interior and limited battery life are limiting factors.
